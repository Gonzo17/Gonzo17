# Hello there! 👋  

I'm a passionate developer who loves to explore new technologies and build cool things. If it involves code, curiosity, and a bit of chaos, I'm in!  

- 😺 My cat Merlin runs the place. I just pay the bills.  
- 🎵 Good music keeps me in the flow, occasional headbanging included.
- 💡 Always tinkering with new ideas — some turn into projects, others into "well, that was interesting..." moments.
- 🎮 Gaming, tech, and nerd culture are a big part of my life.
- 🌱 Low-key trying to develop a green thumb (with Merlin's quality control).  
- 🛠 Web development, software architecture, and building things that just make sense.
